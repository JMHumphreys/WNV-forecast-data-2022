team_model_designation: primary
methods: Divided our analysis between counties with less than 10 cases/yr on average and more. For less, we used 2005-2021 WNND case data and applied a negative binomial or poisson distribution. For more, we applied the single best climate predictor or case counts in the prior year.
ensemble_of_hub_models: false
data_inputs: 2005-2021 neuroinvasive case data, PRISM Climate Data from Oregon State University
team_funding: Los Alamos National Laboratory, Laboratory Directed Research and Development, XX9E, CIMMID project. JAS was supported by an appointment to the Intelligence Community Postdoctoral Research Fellowship Program at Los Alamos National Laboratory administered by Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) through an interagency agreement between the US DOE and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.
methods_long: We employed three different approaches for our model. We first analyzed the mean annual case counts from 2005-2021 for each county. If the county had equal to or less than 10 cases per year on average, we used the annual WNND case data from 2005-2021 and applied a negative binomial or Poisson distribution based on the historical WNND case counts. Where variance of the annual case counts was greater than the mean, we applied a negative binomial distribution calculated from the historical data. If the variance of the annual case counts was less than the mean, we applied a Poisson distribution. For counties that had at  greater than 10 cases/yr on average (n = 13), we created a linear or quadratic forecast model of mean annual case incidence (cases per 100,000 population per year, using county-level population data). We used the single best predictor variable from: annual or seasonal (SON previous year, DJF starting previous year, MAM of same year) mean air temperature, maximum air temperature, minimum air temperature, mean dew point temperature, mean maximum vapor pressure deficit, mean minimum vapor pressure deficit, cumulative precipitation, or WNND case counts of the previous year. All climate variables were processed from the PRISM Climate Group at Oregon State University. For future 2022 data, we used the provisional 6 month PRISM climate data available. We created a point forecast to represent the 50% percentile using the single-predictor models. Then, we combined this point forecast with the historical WNND case counts for each of the counties to create a negative binomial distribution.
