methods: County-Level Bayesian Negative Binomial regression with a log-link function using R-INLA
data_inputs: Land cover data were obtained on the county scale from the national land cover database. Vector data were obtained through the Defense Technical Information Center, Population data was obtained through the US Census Bureau, and elevation data were obtained from the USGS DEM 100-Meter Resolution Elevation of the Conterminuous United States, and bird species data were obtained from the eBird database
methods_long: Predictions were calculated using a Bayesian Negative Binomial regression with a log-link function. Predictors chosen for the final model included the population of individuals aged 65 and up in each county, open water, developed medium intensity, developed high intensity, barren land, deciduous forest, evergreen forest, mixed forest, shrub scrub, herbaceous, and woody wetlands landcover data, sparrow species count, jay species count, crow species count, time variables to account for oscillating cycles in West Nile Virus cases, and year.  As West Nile Virus cases tend to exhibit a three-year cycle of increase and decrease, indicator variables for cycle-year (cycle year 1, cycle year 2, or cycle year 3 (reference level) were included in the model. Because the effect of time varied across regions, we used random effects to allow the coefficients for year to be county-specific, in addition to a random effects intercept. Specifically, these coefficients followed a conditional auto-regressive model at the county level. An integrated nested LaPlace approximation (INLA) model in R software was used to fit our model. This provided a faster way to fit our model than standard Markov chain Monte Carlo methods.
